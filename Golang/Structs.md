Structs defines an __API to constrain and to allow only certain keys__.

> no hierarchy in Golang â‡’ translates to there is no inheritance

~~When defining a type based on another user defined type, methods available to the base type are not accessible to the type defined.~~

User defined types based on in built types can be assigned literals and constants that are compatible with the underlying type.

A struct is a __sequence of named elements__, called __fields__, each of which has a _name_ and a _type_. Field names may be specified explicitly (IdentifierList) or implicitly (EmbeddedField). Within a struct, non-blankÂ field names must beÂ __unique__.

```go 
type person struct {
	name string 
	age int 
	pet string }


var fred person

bob := person{}
// **Both initialize all fields in the struct to their zero values**
```

>You can perform a _type conversion_ from one struct type to anotherÂ if the fields of both structs have the same names, order, and types.Â 
>		*for this to work the struct has to be initialized* [[[[Go bits and bytes#Implicit conversion]]


#### Struct composition
A struct typeÂ `T`Â __may not contain a field__ of typeÂ `T`, or of a __type containingÂ `T`Â as a component__, directly or indirectly, if those containing types are only array or struct types.

```go 
// invalid struct types
type (
	T1 struct{ T1 }       // T1 contains a field of T1
	T2 struct{ f [10]T2 } // T2 contains T2 as component of an array
	T3 struct{ T4 }       // T3 contains T3 as component of an array in struct T4
	T4 struct{ f [10]T3 } // T4 contains T4 as component of struct T3 in an array
)

// valid struct types
type (
	T5 struct{ f *T5 }       // T5 contains T5 as component of a pointer
	T6 struct{ f func() T6 } // T6 contains T6 as component of a function type
	T7 struct{ f [10][]T7 }  // T7 contains T7 as component of a slice in an array
```

> Type conversion between types sharing the same underlying type keep the same storage but associate different methods.
> 
> 	>**types that share the same underlying type** can be **converted between each other**, and this conversion:
> 	>- **Does not copy or allocate new memory**, it's a compile-time type change.
> 	>- **Does not carry over methods**, because methods are associated with the _named type_, not the underlying type

â‡’ When you have the same underlying data but different sets of operations to perform make use of two types.

## Methods

Functions with receivers

Pointer Receivers

â‡’ Method modifies the receiver, the effects of the method to the value received are required to be visible outside the method definition.

Value Receivers

â‡’ Effects of the method on the value received are not needed outside the method definition

A `method call` in go is converted into a `function call` 

Method names cannot be _overloaded_. Using the same method names for different methods on the same type is not allowed as it complicates code clarity and readability.


### Method Sets
struct typeÂ `S`Â and aÂ [named type](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Types)Â `T`, promoted methods are included in the method set of the struct as follows:

- IfÂ `S`Â contains an embedded fieldÂ `T`, theÂ [method sets](https://go.dev/ref/spec#Method_sets)Â ofÂ `S`Â andÂ `*S`Â both include promoted methods with receiverÂ `T`. The method set ofÂ `S`Â also includes promoted methods with receiverÂ `T`.
- IfÂ `S`Â contains an embedded fieldÂ `*T`, the method sets ofÂ `S`Â andÂ `*S`Â both include promoted methods with receiverÂ `T`Â orÂ `*T`.
