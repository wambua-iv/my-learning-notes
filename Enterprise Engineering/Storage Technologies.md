   A strip is a term that is related to a single disk, and is a predefined number of contiguous addressable blocks in that disk. A stripe comes in action in case of a RAID set, it is the set of strips spanning across all the drives in that RAID set.
   Stripe depth is known as strip size also. It is the number of blocks in a particular strip, and is the maximum amount of data that can be written to or read from a single HDD in the set before the next HDD is accessed, assuming that the accessed data starts at the beginning of the strip.
     Stripe size is multiple of Strip size (stripe depth) and number of HDDs in the RAID.
